## Objective
Apply different supervised classification algorithms for estimating the success of a software project.

Determine the success ratio for the software project based on the collection of success critical software development and management features. 

## Approach 
Obtain data (important features) for determining the success for a software project.
Clean the data by feature elimination and normalize the values for analysis.
Run a few models which results in good classifcation of the test data.

### LogisticRegression based Classifier
ClassifierLR.py - a linear model which performs logistic regression which determines the success rate for the software project.
